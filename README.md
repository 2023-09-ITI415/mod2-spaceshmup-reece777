The concept for this design is to have an ability called thorns that briefly allows the player to damage enemies by touching them. The original plan was to have the ability be dropped as a powerup, but I found it easier to implement it as an innate ability with a cooldown. I originally wanted the Enemy to take 5 damage on trigger enter and 1 damage on trigger stay, but had issues figuring out the damaging code, so instead it's an instant kill. The shield turns blue while thorns is active. Thorns lasts for 5 seconds and has a 5-second cool down.
